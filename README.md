Python microservice vs Node

Python SQLAlchemy is absurdly complicated whereas Node just hands me JSON objects.
I can't use .env file without adding Python code
Debugging is less elegant, for Node, nodemon works well
Python virtual environments are a pain compared to NPM

```
cd server
npm start
```

On the other hand my node test server crashes about once every 5 minutes.
